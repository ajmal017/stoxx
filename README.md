# stoxx: A simple tool to analyze stock data. 

The stock data is loaded from yahoo and simple analysis can be performed as e.g. the 20/200 days moving average (in German: GD20, GD200)).

TODO: 
    * Check if GD200 is correct (compare to boerse.de, dont consider intra day)
    * Update stock data.
    * Implement other criteria.
